# LineFlowSolver

The line flow solvers solves the following problem:

Given a graph and a set of lines, assign lines to edges, such that the
overall edge cost is minimized.

Input:

* A directed graph
* A cost vector for each edge
* A set of lines 1..L
* Tuples of edge/line combinations that fix lines to edges
* A set of edges where only one line can be assigned to

Output:

* An assignment of lines to edges
