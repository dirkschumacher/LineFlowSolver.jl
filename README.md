# LineFlowSolver

The line flow solvers solves the following problem:

Given a graph and a set of lines, assign lines to edges, such that the
overall edge cost is minimized.

Input:

* A directed graph
* A cost vector for each edge
* A set of lines 1..L
* Tuples of edge/line combinations that fix lines to edges
* A set of edges where only one line can be assigned to

Goal: Minimize the sume of cost of all line/edge tuples

Subject to:

* Certain line/edge tuples are fixed
* Only one line can be assigned to certain edges
* If a line enters a node, then a line must also leave the node

Output:

* An assignment of lines to edges
